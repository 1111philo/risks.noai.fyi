    <h1>The Boy Who Cried Wolf</h1>
    <p>Once in a distant village, a boy named Timmy was responsible for watching over the sheep. The job was mundane, and Timmy was often bored. Wanting to stir some excitement, he thought, "What if I scream that a wolf is attacking? That would surely bring everyone running!"</p>

    <p>Without a wolf in sight, Timmy cried, "Wolf! Wolf!" and the villagers, fearing for their livestock, ran to his aid. Finding no wolf, they returned, slightly annoyed. Timmy found their reaction amusing.</p>

    <p>A few days later, wanting to relive the amusement, he cried wolf again. The villagers ran to help, but once again, they found no wolf. The irritation in the village grew.</p>

    <p>One evening, as twilight descended, an actual wolf appeared, eyeing the sheep hungrily. In genuine fear, Timmy screamed for help, "Wolf! Real Wolf!" But the villagers did not come running. They thought it was another of Timmy's pranks. The wolf had a feast that night.</p>

    <h2>Lesson to AI Risk Researchers</h2>
    <div class="lesson">
        In the world of AI research, it's essential to be genuine about the risks. Continuously raising false alarms or exaggerating threats for personal gain, attention, or funding might temporarily get you in the spotlight. Still, it erodes trust. And when a real risk emerges, your cries might fall on deaf ears. Be genuine, be truthful, and ensure that your warnings are based on sound research.
